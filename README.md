Versioning Note: Please manually update the version note on each asset after each update. For extra readability add a themed word that is alphabetically incremented next to the version. Example: v1.0 - Aragon becomes v 1.1 Bilbo. The exact naming scheme is not important or uniform across assets. using a codeword just makes discussion easier.
